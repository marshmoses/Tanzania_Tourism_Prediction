# Tanzania_Tourism_Prediction:

Tourist Expenditure Prediction Model:

INTRODUCTION:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the range of expenditures
a tourist might incur while visiting Tanzania. The model is intended to assist tour operators and
the Tanzania Tourism Board in estimating the expenditure of tourists from different countries,
age groups, travel companions, and other relevant factors. 
By providing an accurate expenditure estimate, this model can help tourists plan their trips 
effectively and enable tourism stakeholders to offer tailored services.

DATASET:

The dataset used for this project consists of two CSV files: Train.csv and Test.csv.
Each row in these files represents a different tour, with various attributes
such as the tourist's country of origin, age group, travel companions,
purpose of the trip, main activity, information source, tour arrangement, and more.
Additionally, the dataset includes the total cost of the tour, which serves as the target variable for our prediction model.
